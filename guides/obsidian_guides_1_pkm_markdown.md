# Obsidian Series – Part 1: PKM, Obsidian, and Markdown

## Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)

Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) is all about **organizing, storing, and retrieving all the information you encounter in your daily life**. This could be notes, ideas, readings, experiences, or any kind of knowledge you find important.

**Why is PKM valuable?**

- It helps you avoid losing useful information you read, hear, or come up with.
- It lets you quickly find what you need—no more searching through piles of notes or trying to remember every detail.
- It supports learning and growth: you can more easily see how your thoughts, ideas, and knowledge connect.
- It turns information overload into real knowledge, actionable ideas, or even finished solutions.

**What is PKM for?**

- Organizing ideas, notes, readings, and experiences.
- Managing projects, tasks, learning, or even daily life.
- Building your own knowledge base, where everything important is at your fingertips.

## Obsidian: Your PKM Power Tool

Obsidian stands out as a PKM tool because it lets you **build your system exactly how you want it—easily and transparently**. All your notes are stored as simple, small, and readable text files, so your information stays safe and accessible for the long term.

Obsidian makes it easy to **connect your notes**—whether you’re linking topics, projects, or people—so you’re not just collecting information, but building a network of knowledge.

**How can you organize your notes in Obsidian?**

- **Folders:** Perfect for traditional, hierarchical organization.
- **Tags:** Useful when a note belongs to multiple topics or for quick searching.
- **Links:** Build relationships between notes, creating a web of connections.
- **Metadata:** Properties you assign to notes (like dates, statuses, or types) for filtering and summary tables.

**When should you use each method?**

- **Folders:** For separating big topics or projects.
- **Tags:** For flexible, overlapping categories.
- **Links:** For mapping relationships and connections.
- **Metadata:** For advanced filtering and database-style views.

With Obsidian, you’re not just taking notes—you’re building a **living, interconnected knowledge system** where everything is easy to find and expand.

## Markdown: The Simple Language Behind Obsidian

Markdown is a very simple, human-readable text format. Think of it as a plain text note, but with a few easy symbols (like `#`, `*`, or `-`) to show what’s a heading, a list, or bold text. Markdown files are tiny because they contain only your text and these clear formatting marks—no hidden formatting or extra data.

**Why is Markdown great?**

- You can open and read the text with any editor, now or years from now.
- Formatting marks are clear and help you quickly scan the text (for example: `# Heading`, `- List item`, `**bold**`).
- It’s much simpler than a Word document—no hidden code or complex menus.
- It’s easy to convert to other formats (like PDF or web pages), but is also perfectly readable on its own.

---

**A quick example:**

# This is a heading
This is a paragraph.

- This is the first list item
- This is the second item

**This is bold text**

---

Markdown also **supports version control** extremely well. Since Markdown files are plain text, it’s easy to track changes, restore earlier versions, or collaborate with others using tools like Git. This is much harder with closed or complex file formats (like Word documents).

**In summary:**  
Markdown is a fast, clear, and reliable way to take notes and organize text—making it the perfect foundation for your Obsidian vault and PKM system.
