# Obsidian PKM Snippets & Guides

Obsidian PKM is a fantastic tool with amazing features, but it's like a blank page. 
We need to create the logic ourselves for organizing our knowledge and tasks within it. 
To support this, I want to provide help with guides, templates, and snippets.

## Guides

- [Vault Backup, Sync, and Version Control](guides/vault_backup_sync_version_control.md):  
  A detailed manual on organizing your Obsidian vault with cloud sync, version control using JJ and Git, automation scripts, and best practices for reliable backup and cross-platform compatibility.
